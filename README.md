About This Project
On my first day of data journalism course, I found myself wondering: How can we combine emotional expression with data visualization? This project represents my initial exploration into that question.
I spent a spring morning with friends, shooting video and wandering through Central Park, recording all the fleeting feelings and observations that came to mind. The goal was to capture not just the physical journey, but the emotional landscape of our experience.
What I Built
This interactive story map weaves together:

Location data: Scraped from Central Park's official website
Personal narrative: Our recorded thoughts and feelings from that morning
Visual storytelling: Using MapBox's storytelling template to create an immersive experience

Technical Details

Data Collection: Web scraped location information and descriptions from CentralPark.com
Visualization Framework: Built using MapBox Storytelling Template
Content: Original video footage and audio recordings from our Central Park walk

The Experiment
This project sits at the intersection of:

Data journalism techniques
Personal narrative storytelling
Interactive web mapping
Emotional geography

It's an attempt to answer whether data visualization can carry not just information, but feeling—whether we can map not just where we went, but how it felt to be there.

What I Learned
This was my first foray into combining subjective experience with objective data. The challenge wasn't just technical—it was figuring out how to make data feel human, and how to make feelings feel mappable.
