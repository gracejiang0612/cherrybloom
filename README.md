# Emotional Cartography: A Spring Walk Through Central Park

The first day I take data journalism course, I am wondering — how can I combine emotional expression with dataviz or visual perception. And this is the first time I approach to it. I spent a spring morning with my friends, shooting video and walking around Central Park. And record all my nonsense feeling. For the data viz part, I first scrape the location and description on Central Park.com and then use a storytelling template from MapBox: https://github.com/mapbox/storytelling.

## What I Built

This interactive story map weaves together:
- **Location data**: Scraped from Central Park's official website
- **Personal narrative**: Our recorded thoughts and feelings from that morning
- **Visual storytelling**: Using MapBox's storytelling template to create an immersive experience

## Technical Details

- **Data Collection**: Web scraped location information and descriptions from CentralPark.com
- **Visualization Framework**: Built using [MapBox Storytelling Template](https://github.com/mapbox/storytelling)
- **Content**: Original video footage and audio recordings from our Central Park walk

## The Experiment

This project sits at the intersection of:
- Data journalism techniques
- Personal narrative storytelling  
- Interactive web mapping
- Emotional geography

It's an attempt to answer whether data visualization can carry not just information, but feeling—whether we can map not just where we went, but how it felt to be there.

## What I Learned

This was my first foray into combining subjective experience with objective data. The challenge wasn't just technical—it was figuring out how to make data feel human, and how to make feelings feel mappable.
